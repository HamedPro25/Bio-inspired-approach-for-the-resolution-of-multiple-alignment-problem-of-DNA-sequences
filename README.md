# Bio-inspired approach for the resolution of multiple alignment problem of DNA sequences

## Description
This is a python project created using PySide2 and Qt Designer. <br />
The project purpose is to resolve the multiple alignment probelm of DNA sequences using two approchs:<br />
1. Gentic Algorithm. <br />
2. Simulated annealing.
